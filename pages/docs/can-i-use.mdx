# Can I use Sittly?

You must meet the following requirements to use Sittly:

## System Requirements

### Operating System

- ❌ ~Windows~
- ❌ ~MacOS~
- ✅ Linux

### X11 desktop

You must be using a X11 based desktop environment (e.g. GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)

If you don't know what this means throw this in your terminal and see if it works:

```bash filename="terminal" copy
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```

If it prints `x11` then you're good to go!
If not then you're probably using a Wayland based desktop environment (e.g. GNOME on Wayland) and Sittly won't work for you unless you switch to a X11 based desktop environment.
